        <div id="discussion">I'm interested in and try to learn multiple partners dances.
            <br>The criteria for a dance that I'll like is that it has a structure (rules, known movements and interactions) that allows you to dance with strangers, but is full improvisational within this structure, and is dances to a piece of music.
            <br>Often these dances are with a single dancer partner for the duration of a piece of music or several pieces of music. But large group dances are great fun too!
